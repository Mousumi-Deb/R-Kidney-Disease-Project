# R Project: Kidney Disease Analysis

This R project focuses on the analysis of a dataset related to kidney diseases. The project involves implementing basic algorithms, performing data preprocessing, and creating data visualizations to gain insights into the dataset.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about various attributes related to kidney diseases, including age, blood pressure, specific gravity, albumin, sugar, red blood cells, pus cell, etc. Each instance in the dataset represents a patient and their corresponding attributes.

## Objectives
The primary objectives of this project include:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and ensuring data consistency.
2. **Algorithm Implementation**: Implementing basic algorithms for data analysis, such as classification or clustering algorithms, to identify patterns and trends in the data.
3. **Data Visualization**: Creating visualizations, such as histograms, scatter plots, and box plots, to explore relationships between different attributes and gain insights into the dataset.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- R programming language
- Tidyverse: For data manipulation and visualization
- Caret: For machine learning algorithms
- GGplot2: For creating customized visualizations
- Other relevant R libraries as needed

## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following directories and files:

- **data/**: Contains the dataset files.
- **scripts/**: Includes R scripts for data preprocessing, algorithm implementation, and visualization.
- **plots/**: Stores visualizations generated during the analysis.
- **README.md**: This file providing an overview of the project and instructions for running the code.
- **requirements.txt**: Specifies the dependencies required to run the project.


## Conclusion
This project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of kidney disease data using R programming. Through data preprocessing, algorithm implementation, and visualization, we aim to gain a better understanding of the dataset and potentially contribute to the field of kidney disease research.
